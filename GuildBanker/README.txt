*WARNING: THIS ADDON WILL OVERWRITE YOUR GUILD OFFICER NOTES*

Guild Banker logs all guild bank transactions and keeps a running balance for all guild members. Open the guild bank, click the Audit button and the transaction logs and balances will be updated. Guild bank balances are stored in each members officer note.

Gold values can be assigned to items by either entering the value manually or import the values from the Auctionator database (requires the Auctionator addon). Otherwise the default vendor price will be used for items.
